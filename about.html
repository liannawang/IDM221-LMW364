            Hi, I'm Lianna, an aspiring UI/UX Designer from Newtown, Pennsylvania. I'm currenly studying User Experience and Interaction Design for my second year at Drexel University. I am passionate about designing human-centered solutions that put the user first.

Over the summer of my freshman year, I took an UI Quality Control internship for a health information company called IQVIA. Throughout the duration of the internship, I applied my learned knowledge of user interface design to test the interface from both backend and front end to make sure the user experience was as smooth as possible.  

When I'm not working on school work, I enjoy working in other creative fields such as art, dance, and music. Along with digital media, I love working with physical art such as pencil and paint. Additionally, from a young age, I've danced ballet and played instruments such as piano, saxophone, and guitar. 

Another thing I'm passionate about is diversity and Asian culture. In high school, I was secretary for the Asian Student Association. At Drexel, I'm apart of the Asian Student Association, Queer Student Union, and Queer People of Color.
